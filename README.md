# Magic Spell Books for Minecraft

This datapack adds 18 magic spell books, a consumable mana system, mana potions, and 2 new villager professions: alchemists and mages, with sub-variants of mages depending on the spell type. Spell books can be obtained from trading with mages. Each mage will sell different types of spells ranging from air, dark, earth, fire, light, and water spells. More powerful spells can be obtained after purchasing the lower tier spells from the mages. Alchemists will sell mana potions and splash mana potions. Both of the new professions of villagers will spawn naturally, just like regular villagers.
